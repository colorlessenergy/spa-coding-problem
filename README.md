## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about managing components and state, completed in React._

## challenge

1. Create an input field (in App component) with a change event listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).
2. Create a new component (ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
3. Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length to output "Text long enough")
4. Create another component (CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).
5. Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.
6. When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.
